# Speed-of-impact-calculator
Calculate speed of impact for a specific question in physics.

Questions like: The driver of a car slams on the brakes when he sees a tree blocking the road. The car slows uniformly with acceleration of âˆ’5.55 m/s^2
for 4.10 s, making straight skid marks 62.8 m long, all the way to the tree. 

A. With what speed (in m/s) does the car then strike the tree? 

B. What acceleration would be required to narrowly not wreck the car?


How to run:
